# pdk_release_management

## Description

Doing a pdk release requires knowledge of a few inter-related repositories.  

Therefore I created this `meta` directory to collect the various repositories.  This is a work in progress and my aim is to collect documentation to explain and illustrate the process.

## Usage

* Pull in the latest devx repositories via ``meta git update``.
